     "question": "How do I use this page?",
     "answer": "We believe that the best way to learn a language is by talking and having conversations. When you create an account you are able to see and create events, so that you can connect with other people to learn the language. To find an event, you search by either language or place. All neccessary info about the event should be in the description. After you've found an event, the only thing you need to do is attend!"

     "question": "Why is it called languable?",
     "answer": "It is a play on words! Where is one of the best places to hang out and socialize? At a cafe of course! We wanted to incorporate that feeling, and that is why we connected the word \"language\" and \"table\" to each other. Conversing with other people is also what makes you more \"able\" to speak in the end."

        "answer": "No, you do not have to pay to join. Languable is a completely free, as we want as many people as possible to be able to practice languages."
