## Final Project: Languable by Kartika & Neah

The idea behind this project is based on our experiences living in countries that required us to speak a whole different languages. Sometimes, it can be lonely to try to learn and practice your target language by yourself. So we want to create a space where people can learn languages casually-- with no pressure or judgement. 

## Tech

For this project, we use Firebase for our backend authentication. We also use MongoDB, Express and NodeJS for the server. For our frontend, we use React, Styled Components, and JavaScript.
The design was made in Canva.
